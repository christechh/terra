PinChat aims to provide a simpler way to make user connection and engagement easier in each scenario.<br/><br/>Over the past ten years, an increasing percentage of users have begun to use instant messaging software for workplace communication instead of just personal use, which resulted in a mix of workplace and personal messages, including text and files. However, the traditional IM has been unable to facilitate users to switch between private and work/business scenarios smoothly, making it difficult for users to manage conversations with others.<br/><br/>In addition, today’s IM software and social networking service (SNS) have been tied together. Once you add friends and start a chat with people you aren’t familiar with, your data, such as photos, names, videos, etc., are also exposed on these social platforms.<br/><br/>We realized this problem and built PinChat.",
